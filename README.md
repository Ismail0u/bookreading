#  Book Reading Library

**A modern mini web application for managing a personal reading list and exploring books, built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.**

> This project was developed during my web development internship at **Codveda Technology**.
> It serves as a demonstration of my skills in front-end frameworks, state management, dynamic filtering, and building responsive, modern UIs.

## Technologies Used

This project uses a modern, efficient, and fast development stack:

* **Frontend Framework:** **React (Vite)**

  * *Reason:* Enables component-based architecture, props management, and state handling with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**

  * *Reason:* Utility-first CSS framework for rapid prototyping and responsive design.
* **Build Tool:** **Vite**

  * *Reason:* Extremely fast development server and build process.
* **Data Source:** Local JavaScript file (`booksData.js`) simulating a small database of books.

## Key Features

The app provides a smooth and intuitive experience for browsing your book collection:

* ** Dynamic Search & Filtering**
  Instantly search books by **title** or **author** in real-time from the navigation bar.

* ** Sorting Options**
  Sort the book collection by multiple criteria:

  * Title (A–Z / Z–A)
  * Publication Year (Oldest / Newest)
  * Rating (Highest Rated)

* ** Reusable Components**
  Built using modular React components (`Header`, `Hero`, `BookCard`) for clean and scalable architecture.

* ** Fully Responsive Design**
  The layout adapts beautifully to all screen sizes — desktop, tablet, and mobile — thanks to Tailwind CSS.

##  Installation & Setup

Follow these simple steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ismail0u/bookreading.git
   cd .\intro_to_react_app\the_app\
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Your app should now be running at  [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) (or the port provided by Vite).
